  abstract = {A combination of a dynamic energy budget (DEB) model, field data on Atlantic salmon Salmo salar and brown trout Salmo trutta and laboratory data on Atlantic salmon was used to assess the underlying assumptions of three different metrics of growth including specific growth rate (G), standardized mass-specific growth rate (GS) and absolute growth rate in length (GL) in salmonids. Close agreement was found between predictions of the DEB model and the assumptions of linear growth in length and parabolic growth in mass. Field data comparing spring growth rates of age 1+ year and 2+ year Atlantic salmon demonstrated that in all years the larger age 2+ year fish exhibited a significantly lower G, but differences in growth in terms of GS and GL depended on the year examined. For brown trout, larger age 2+ year fish also consistently exhibited slower growth rates in terms of G but grew at similar rates as age 1+ year fish in terms of GS and GL. Laboratory results revealed that during the age 0+ year (autumn) the divergence in growth between future Atlantic salmon smolts and non-smolts was similar in terms of all three metrics with smolts displaying higher growth than non-smolts, however, both GS and GL indicated that smolts maintain relatively fast growth into the late autumn where G suggested that both smolts and non-smolts exhibit a sharp decrease in growth from October to November. During the spring, patterns of growth in length were significantly decoupled from patterns in growth in mass. Smolts maintained relatively fast growth though April in length but not in mass. These results suggest GS can be a useful alternative to G as a size-independent measure of growth rate in immature salmonids. In addition, during certain growth stanzas, GS may be highly correlated with GL. The decoupling of growth in mass from growth in length over ontogeny, however, may necessitate a combination of metrics to adequately describe variation in growth depending on ontogenetic stage particularly if life histories differ.},

I examined the importance of prey growth in the interaction between large-mouth bass (Micropterus salmoides) and their prey, bluegill (Lepomis macrochirus), by analyzing diets and growth rates of bass in a set of seven lakes in south-central Wisconsin. Sizes of bluegill consumed by bass changed dramatically across a gradient of bluegill growth, which resulted in differing patterns of bass growth. In lakes with slow bluegill growth, small bass fed on the youngest bluegill cohort, but large bass were capable of feeding on several age classes. Consequently, bass growth rates were strongly size-dependent; small bass ate small prey and had low growth, but growth rates increased substantially with size as bass ate progressively larger prey. When bluegill had high growth rates, they quickly reached a size refuge from predation and bass of all sizes were restricted to feeding on the youngest/smallest prey. In these lakes, bass growth rates were more uniform across bass sizes. Because growth rates influence population size-distributions, variation in bluegill growth can have strong effects on the structure of bass populations. These effects could potentially feed back to further influence the interaction between predator and prey.},

  abstract = {How large size affects overwinter growth and survival of age-0 fish may vary as a function of food, predation, and energetic condition. During two winters in Ohio, we assessed how these factors affected growth and survival of varying sizes of age-0 largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides) by combining a field survey (N = 2 reservoirs) with multiscale experiments (reservoirs, ponds, outdoor pools). In our survey, more small ({$<$}100 mm total length) individuals died by spring in one reservoir than in the other. Similarly, when we stocked two reservoirs with marked age-0 largemouth bass in fall, mortality of small individuals was higher in one system overwinter, potentially due to differences in predation intensity. In ponds during two winters, size-selective mortality of small largemouth bass occurred in only two of eight ponds, potentially as a function of cannibalism. Varying ration in pools (starved, 0.5\texttimes{} maintenance, or 1.5\texttimes{} maintenance) did not affect survival, even though starved individuals lost substantial wet weight and energy content. Only when predators were present did small individuals die at high rates, although energy depletion may have contributed to predatory mortality. To increase the probability of overwinter survival, managers should seek to improve first-summer growth, reduce winter predation, and increase winter forage.},

  abstract = {SynopsisIn this study, we used pumpkinseed,Lepomis gibbosus, populations in two east-central Ontario lakes to test for age and size-dependent effects on the probability and timing of reproduction of mature females. Pumpkinseed body size characteristics differed in the two lakes; Little Round Lake harbours a stunted population and Beloporine Lake does not. Age-class distribution of mature females was determined by a maturity assessment on fish collected just prior to spawning and at the mid-spawning period, combined with an early-season capture-mark-recapture survey. Spawning females were collected throughout the breeding season to assess age and size-related temporal trends, and to compare their age and size distribution with that of mature females at large. The proportion of age 2 females in Little Round Lake that actually spawned was considerably lower than the proportion of mature age 2 females at large. Furthermore, age 2 females that spawned in this lake did not do so until late in the breeding season. In contrast, the proportion of young/small females spawning in Beloporine Lake was comparable to the proportion of young/small mature females at large, and both small and large females spawned throughout the breeding season. Small mature females in Little Round Lake may have had no other option but to spawn late in the season because of their poor body condition. In Beloporine Lake, condition factor early in the breeding season in age 2\textendash{}4 females was higher than that of Little Round Lake females, suggesting that limited energy reserves in the spring may have prevented young Little Round Lake females from early spawning. Our results show that the likelihood and timing of reproduction are both age and size-dependent in some populations. Small individuals that delay seasonal maturation and spawn late in the summer probably contribute little to the population due to the restricted growth and reduced overwinter survival of their progeny.},

However, these prey fish commonly outgrow their vulnerability to white crappie predation in some, but not all, northern Missouri reservoirs. Potential variables that could influence abundance, growth and mortality of age-0 gizzard shad were examined in three reservoirs that differed with respect to age-0 gizzard shad growth rates. Because of thermal effluent from a power plant, gizzard shad spawned earlier in Thomas Hill Lake and initial densities of larvae were greater than in the other reservoirs. Larval and juvenile gizzard shad grew slowest in Thomas Hill Lake, followed by Mark Twain Lake and Long Branch Lake. Growth rate of larvae increased with increasing water temperature and food abundance, but decreased with increasing conspecific density. Similar relationships were found for juvenile growth, except that growth declined with increasing temperature. The slower growth of larvae and juveniles in Thomas Hill Lake was probably a consequence of their greater densities relative to their food abundance and higher water temperatures during the juvenile stage. Conversely, both larvae and juvenile gizzard shad grew more rapidly and juveniles attained large sizes in Long Branch Lake owing to their lower densities relative to their available food. Mortality of larvae and juveniles was mostly similar among the reservoirs. Because of their greater abundance and slower growth, gizzard shad were available as prey for white crappies for a longer period in Thomas Hill Lake than in the other reservoirs.},

Multiple life stages were examined by stocking walleye at three different size groups: larval (6 mm total length (TL)), small (46 mm TL), and large (100 mm TL). Factors affecting growth and survival of walleye varied depending on walleye size. Growth of small and large walleye increased with benthic invertebrate density. Temperature had a positive effect on larval and small walleye growth but a negative effect on large walleye growth. Prey availability was an important factor for walleye survival across all size groups, whereas temperature affected only larval and large walleye. Juvenile centrarchid density had a negative effect on larval walleye survival, presumably caused by predation. Our best predictive models explained substantial variation in survival for larval (97\%), small (57\%), and large (83\%) walleye. We also explained a high proportion of variation in growth of large (98\%), small (55\%), and larval (52\%) walleye. Our study demonstrates the importance of examining multiple life stages to predict growth and survival and leads to a better understanding of walleye recruitment and recommendations for stocking strategies.

  abstract = {Upon invading the Great Lakes, the round goby (Neogobius melanostomus) was rapidly incorporated in the diet of native predators. The smallmouth bass (Micropterus dolomieu) is an abundant nearshore predator and readily consumes round goby; however, the effects of round goby on growth of smallmouth bass have not been examined for a wide range of smallmouth bass ages. We compared smallmouth bass diets from New York waters of Lake Erie before and after the invasion of round goby and analyzed 19years (pre-round goby=1993\textendash{}1998; post-round goby=2001\textendash{}2013) of length-at-age data (ages 2\textendash{}10) to investigate the effects of round goby on growth of smallmouth bass. Analysis of variance was used to test hypotheses about the effects of sex, age, and round goby presence on length-at-age of smallmouth bass, and von Bertalanffy models were used to identify changes in growth patterns. Crayfish (Decapoda spp.) were the most common prey of smallmouth bass prior to invasion of round goby (observed in 53.5\% of diets). Round goby became the dominant prey of smallmouth bass after its invasion (observed in 73.3\% of diets), and crayfish were only observed in 5.8\% of diets in the post-round goby time period. Length-at-age increased following invasion of round goby and the greatest increases in length (11\textendash{}15\%) were observed for ages 2\textendash{}4. The von Bertalanffy growth coefficient, K, increased for both male and female smallmouth bass.

Using a photoperiod of 15 h light : 9 h dark, we quantified the diel use of artificial macrophytes and open water by two size-classes of bluegill Lepomis macrochirus when the open water was empty (control), contained food, or contained both a caged predator and food. Small bluegills (6.2\textendash{}7.7 cm total length) spent significantly more time in macrophytes in the predator and food treatment than in the control, followed by the food-only treatment. In addition, small bluegills spent significantly more time in macrophytes during the day than at night in all treatments. The frequency with which small bluegills were found in the same location in subsequent observations was significantly higher in the predator and food treatment during the day than in any other treatment and light combination. Large bluegills (10.2\textendash{}13.0 cm total length) showed no difference in habitat use among treatments but spent significantly less time in macrophytes at night than during the day. There was no difference in the frequency with which large bluegills were found in the same location in subsequent observations among treatments or light levels. This suggests the potential for a diel littoral-pelagic habitat change by juvenile bluegills that would have important implications for the role of bluegills in lake food webs, including the possibility of nutrient translocation that could generate alternate stable states in lakes.},

  abstract = {Previous laboratory studies have demonstrated that turbidity alters prey selection by Largemouth Bass Micropterus salmoides, but this has not been tested in the field. Laboratory studies have also suggested that daily rates of consumption by Largemouth Bass may decline as turbidity increases and that the rate of decline may differ among prey types, possibly providing a mechanism that drives the observed prey selection patterns. We conducted laboratory trials to measure daily consumption rates for Largemouth Bass when foraging on Bluegills Lepomis macrochirus and Gizzard Shad Dorosoma cepedianum; we also collected field data in three reservoir systems (Boomer, Sooner, and Guthrie lakes, Oklahoma) during 2 years to evaluate Largemouth Bass prey selection and consumption rates over a range of turbidity levels. In the laboratory trials, Largemouth Bass daily consumption rates declined with increased turbidity, but the decline was similar between the two prey types. We detected no correlations between turbidity and consumption rate (percentage of empty stomachs or mean weight of prey in stomach contents) in the field. Field-measured prey selection was highly variable among reservoirs and between sampling years, yet all but one reservoir \texttimes\texttimes{} year combination had significant correlations between prey selection and turbidity, which generally followed the predictions of previous laboratory results (greater use of fish prey [especially centrarchids] and reduced use of crayfish at high levels of turbidity). However, the use of crayfish prey under low-turbidity conditions was higher than that expected based on previous laboratory trials. Further research is needed to determine which factors regulate the effects of increased turbidity on predator foraging return and to evaluate the food web implications of turbidity-related changes in the diets of top predators.Received December 3, 2014; accepted June 25, 2015},

  abstract = {We evaluated the relationships between the growth rate of bluegill Lepomis macrochirus and lake morphometry and water quality at 1,146 Minnesota lakes to determine the potential strength of the latter two variables in a model of bluegill growth. Secchi depth and maximum depth were negatively correlated with bluegill length at ages 1\textendash{}6, whereas total alkalinity, percent of littoral area, and mean maximum July air temperature were positively correlated with bluegill length at those ages. Secchi depth, maximum depth, and total alkalinity explained 16\textendash{}33\% of the variation in the growth of bluegill through their first 5 years. The lake morphometry and water quality variables did not explain more of the variation in bluegill growth among lakes because other variables, such as food resources, species interactions, and exploitation also affect bluegill growth. However, these two variables can be used to preliminarily sort candidate lakes for regulation of recreational angling for bluegill and should be considered when modeling bluegill growth.},

  abstract = {Climate change is expected to alter temperature regimes experienced by fishes, which may also alter life history traits. However, predicting population-level responses to climate change has been difficult. Metabolic theory of ecology has been developed to explain how metabolism controls a variety of ecological processes, including life history attributes. Thus, this theory may be a useful tool for predicting fish population responses to climate change. To understand how climate change may alter freshwater fish life history, we measured population characteristics (e.g., recruitment, growth, body size, and mortality) of 21 North American common carp Cyprinus carpio populations spanning a latitudinal gradient of {$>$}2,700 km. We then evaluated (1) how metabolic rates vary with body size and temperature (i.e., metabolic theory of ecology) to interpret latitudinal patterns in life history traits and (2) how predicted increases in annual temperature as a result of climate change may alter metabolism and population characteristics. Common carp growth and mortality decreased whereas fish size and age increased with increasing latitude. Common carp growth rate was 22\% faster but mortality was 31\% higher for the most southern population compared to the most northern population. Incorporating latitudinal population patterns into metabolic theory of ecology models explained substantial variation in mortality and longevity among populations and suggested that metabolism will increase with temperature according to three global warming scenarios. The greatest metabolic increase occurred at the largest predicted increase in temperature and metabolism increased more for southern populations compared to northern populations. Combined, our findings suggest common carp and other fishes may experience increased growth and metabolic demands but populations may attain smaller body size due to higher mortality in response to climate change.},
